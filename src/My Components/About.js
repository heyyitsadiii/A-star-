        <p>  A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.
        Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections. 
        And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation). 
        Consider a square grid having many obstacles and we are given a starting cell and a target cell. We want to reach the target cell (if possible) from the starting cell as quickly as possible. Here A* Search Algorithm comes to the rescue.
        What A* Search Algorithm does is that at each step it picks the node according to a value-‘f’ which is a parameter equal to the sum of two other parameters – ‘g’ and ‘h’. At each step it picks the node/cell having the lowest ‘f’, and process that node/cell.</p>
